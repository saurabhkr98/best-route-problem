# best-route-problem


This solution is very generic in the sense that this will work in case of n number of consumers and restaurants.
We generated all possible sequences of restaurants and cosumers considering the fact that consumer should come after its corresponding restaurant.
Then we calculated the time taken in each sequence and outputed the least possible one.
